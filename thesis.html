#Cell Outage Management Using Machine Learning Methods





## Abstract
   With the arrival of 5G, communication network is becoming more and more complicated leading to increased operating costs and operational difficulty. In the past few years, Self-organizing network (SON) has become a research hotspot which can adjust communication parameters automatically to adapt the change of the environment and decrease operating costs. Self-healing is one of the important parts of SON, which aims to recover the network from faults automatically and improve the user experience. Self-healing mainly includes two parts: cell outage detection and cell outage compensation. This paper uses machine learning method to do the cell outage management. By using density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm, cell outage has been detected. After detecting the cell outage, deep q network (DQN) is applied to compensate the cell outage. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms achieve a good effect.
